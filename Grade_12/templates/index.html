      <h2>About us</h2>
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
      standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
      type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
      remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
      Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
      of Lorem Ipsum.

      <h2>Curriculum</h2>
      Year 12, the final year of secondary education and the culmination of the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE), follows the pivotal Year 11, setting the stage for future opportunities and pathways. With a focus on consolidating knowledge and skills, Year 12 holds a profound influence on university admissions and career prospects. This year carries the weight of academic expectations and calls for a disciplined approach to study, time management, and effective exam preparation. By embracing the significance of Year 12, seeking guidance from educators and mentors, and engaging in focused and purposeful learning, students can maximise their potential, achieve outstanding results, and open doors to a bright and successful future beyond secondary school.
